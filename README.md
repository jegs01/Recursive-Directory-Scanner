# Overview

This project is a recursive directory scanner built using TypeScript. It demonstrates key TypeScript concepts such as classes, recursion, asynchronous programming, and error handling. The scanner traverses directories, lists files and subdirectories, and saves the results to a file. The purpose of this project is to deepen understanding of TypeScript syntax and file system operations while building a useful tool.

A key part of this project was implementing error handling to ensure robust directory traversal and managing filesystem permissions. Additionally, automated testing is included to validate functionality using `vitest`.
